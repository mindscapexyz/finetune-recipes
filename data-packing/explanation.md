**Cursor**

I'll examine the notebook that's currently open to explain what it does.

This notebook is a comprehensive data preprocessing pipeline for fine-tuning audio-enabled language models, specifically the Qwen2-Audio model. Here's what it does:

## Overview
The notebook processes audio instruction datasets and packages them into an efficient format for training multimodal models that can handle both text and audio inputs.

## Key Components

### 1. **Setup & Dependencies** (Cells 0-3)
- Downloads sample audio files
- Sets up environment variables for HuggingFace cache and GPU usage
- Imports necessary libraries including transformers, PEFT (for LoRA), streaming datasets, and audio processing
- Initializes the Qwen2-Audio processor and tokenizer with audio-specific tokens

### 2. **Data Loading** (Cell 5)
- Loads instruction datasets from two JSON files:
  - `prepare-speech-instructions.json`
  - `prepare-transcription-instructions.json`
- These contain audio files paired with text instructions

### 3. **Audio Token Processing** (Cell 6)
- **`get_new_token()`** function: Processes audio files and calculates how many audio tokens are needed based on audio length
- Replaces placeholder `<|AUDIO|>` tokens with the correct number of expanded audio tokens
- Adds special audio boundary tokens (`<|audio_bos|>` and `<|audio_eos|>`)

### 4. **Sequence Packing** (Cells 7-10)
- **`loop()`** function: Implements efficient sequence packing
- Groups multiple instruction examples into 4096-token sequences to maximize GPU utilization
- Uses parallel processing (10 workers) to tokenize and pack the data
- Saves processed data in MDS (MosaicML Streaming Dataset) format

### 5. **Dataset Consolidation** (Cells 11-13)
- Merges all tokenized chunks into a single dataset called `packing-4k`
- Creates a unified 13GB dataset ready for training

### 6. **Training-Ready Dataset Class** (Cells 14-16)
- **`DatasetFixed`**: Custom PyTorch dataset that:
  - Loads audio files and processes them with the feature extractor
  - Creates proper attention masks using block diagonal structure
  - Handles multiple audio files per sequence
  - Sets up labels correctly (masking special tokens)

### 7. **Data Validation** (Cells 17-23)
- Tests the dataset loading and collation
- Visualizes attention masks to verify proper sequence packing
- Shows examples of packed sequences with multiple audio files

### 8. **Upload to HuggingFace** (Cell 25)
- Uploads the final processed dataset to HuggingFace Hub as `huseinzol05/malaysian-audio-instructions`

## Key Innovation: Sequence Packing
The notebook implements sophisticated sequence packing that combines multiple audio instruction examples into single 4096-token sequences. This is crucial for:
- **Efficiency**: Maximizes GPU utilization by avoiding padding waste
- **Performance**: Allows the model to see more examples per batch
- **Memory**: Optimizes memory usage during training

## Output
The final dataset is a 13GB collection of packed audio instruction sequences ready for efficient fine-tuning of audio-enabled language models, particularly focused on Malaysian/multilingual content based on the dataset name and file paths.

is the audio token discrete token or continuous feature?

---

**Cursor**

Looking at the notebook code, the audio tokens are **discrete tokens**, not continuous features. Here's the evidence:

## Audio Token Processing

In Cell 6, the `get_new_token()` function shows how audio is handled:

```python
audio_token = "<|AUDIO|>"
audio_bos_token = "<|audio_bos|>"
audio_eos_token = "<|audio_eos|>"
```

The key part is this calculation:
```python
audio_lengths = [min(3000, math.ceil(len(audio_) / processor.feature_extractor.hop_length))]
# ...
audio_length = audio_lengths.pop(0)
input_length = (audio_length - 1) // 2 + 1
num_audio_tokens = (input_length - 2) // 2 + 1

expanded_audio_token = audio_token * num_audio_tokens
```

This shows that:
1. **Audio is converted to a discrete number of tokens** (`num_audio_tokens`)
2. **Each audio segment gets replaced with multiple `<|AUDIO|>` tokens** - specifically `audio_token * num_audio_tokens`
3. **The number of tokens is calculated based on audio length** using the feature extractor's hop length

## Token Integration

In Cell 3, we see:
```python
audio_token_id = processor.tokenizer._convert_token_to_id_with_added_voc('<|AUDIO|>')
```

And in the dataset class (Cell 16):
```python
data['labels'][data['labels'] == audio_token_id] = -100
```

This confirms that `<|AUDIO|>` tokens are treated as discrete token IDs in the vocabulary, just like text tokens.

## Architecture Implication

The Qwen2-Audio model uses a **discrete tokenization approach** where:
- Audio features are processed separately by the feature extractor
- But in the text sequence, audio is represented by discrete `<|AUDIO|>` tokens
- The model learns to align these discrete audio tokens with the continuous audio features during training

This is different from approaches that directly embed continuous audio features into the token sequence. Instead, it maintains the discrete nature of the language model while using separate audio encoders to process the actual audio content.

```python
audio_token = "<|AUDIO|>"
audio_bos_token = "<|audio_bos|>"
audio_eos_token = "<|audio_eos|>"
```

```python
audio_lengths = [min(3000, math.ceil(len(audio_) / processor.feature_extractor.hop_length))]
# ...
audio_length = audio_lengths.pop(0)
input_length = (audio_length - 1) // 2 + 1
num_audio_tokens = (input_length - 2) // 2 + 1

expanded_audio_token = audio_token * num_audio_tokens
```

```python
audio_token_id = processor.tokenizer._convert_token_to_id_with_added_voc('<|AUDIO|>')
```

```python
data['labels'][data['labels'] == audio_token_id] = -100
```

explain how the number of tokens is calculated based on audio length? what if i use tokenizer that has different TPS

---

**Cursor**

Let me examine the audio token calculation logic more closely and explain how it works with different tokenizers.

Now let me check what the hop_length value is and examine the token calculation logic more carefully:

Based on the code analysis and research, let me explain how the audio token calculation works and what happens with different TPS rates:

## Audio Token Calculation in the Notebook

The calculation happens in the `get_new_token()` function:

```python
# Step 1: Calculate audio length in feature frames
audio_lengths = [min(3000, math.ceil(len(audio_) / processor.feature_extractor.hop_length))]

# Step 2: Calculate number of tokens needed
audio_length = audio_lengths.pop(0)
input_length = (audio_length - 1) // 2 + 1
num_audio_tokens = (input_length - 2) // 2 + 1
```

Let me break this down:

### Step-by-Step Calculation

1. **Raw Audio to Feature Frames**:
   ```python
   audio_length = math.ceil(len(audio_) / processor.feature_extractor.hop_length)
   ```
   - `len(audio_)` = number of audio samples
   - `hop_length` = stride between feature windows (typically 160 for 16kHz audio)
   - This gives the number of feature frames extracted from the audio

2. **Feature Frames to Input Length**:
   ```python
   input_length = (audio_length - 1) // 2 + 1
   ```
   - This appears to be a downsampling step (dividing by 2)
   - Likely corresponds to how Qwen2-Audio's encoder processes features

3. **Input Length to Token Count**:
   ```python
   num_audio_tokens = (input_length - 2) // 2 + 1
   ```
   - Another downsampling step
   - Subtracts 2 (possibly for boundary tokens) then divides by 2 again

4. **Cap at 3000**:
   ```python
   min(3000, ...)
   ```
   - Maximum limit to prevent extremely long sequences

## Example Calculation

For a 10-second audio at 16kHz:
- Raw samples: `10 * 16000 = 160,000 samples`
- Feature frames: `160,000 / 160 = 1,000 frames`
- Input length: `(1000 - 1) // 2 + 1 = 500`
- Audio tokens: `(500 - 2) // 2 + 1 = 250 tokens`

## Impact of Different TPS (Tokens Per Second)

The current implementation has an **effective TPS of ~25** (250 tokens for 10 seconds).

If you use a tokenizer with different TPS:

### Higher TPS (e.g., 50 TPS):
- **Pros**: More granular audio representation, better temporal resolution
- **Cons**: Longer sequences, more memory usage, slower training
- **Example**: 10-second audio → 500 tokens instead of 250

### Lower TPS (e.g., 12.5 TPS):
- **Pros**: Shorter sequences, faster training, less memory
- **Cons**: Coarser audio representation, potential loss of temporal details
- **Example**: 10-second audio → 125 tokens instead of 250

## Adapting the Code for Different TPS

To modify for a different target TPS, you'd need to adjust the downsampling ratios:

```python
# For target TPS of 50 (double current rate)
input_length = audio_length  # Remove first downsampling
num_audio_tokens = (input_length - 2) // 1 + 1  # Remove second downsampling

# For target TPS of 12.5 (half current rate)  
input_length = (audio_length - 1) // 4 + 1  # More aggressive downsampling
num_audio_tokens = input_length
```

The key is ensuring your tokenization rate matches what the model was trained to expect, as the model learns specific relationships between token positions and audio content.

```python
# Step 1: Calculate audio length in feature frames
audio_lengths = [min(3000, math.ceil(len(audio_) / processor.feature_extractor.hop_length))]

# Step 2: Calculate number of tokens needed
audio_length = audio_lengths.pop(0)
input_length = (audio_length - 1) // 2 + 1
num_audio_tokens = (input_length - 2) // 2 + 1
```

```python
   audio_length = math.ceil(len(audio_) / processor.feature_extractor.hop_length)
```

```python
   input_length = (audio_length - 1) // 2 + 1
```

```python
   num_audio_tokens = (input_length - 2) // 2 + 1
```

```python
   min(3000, ...)
```

```python
# For target TPS of 50 (double current rate)
input_length = audio_length  # Remove first downsampling
num_audio_tokens = (input_length - 2) // 1 + 1  # Remove second downsampling

# For target TPS of 12.5 (half current rate)  
input_length = (audio_length - 1) // 4 + 1  # More aggressive downsampling
num_audio_tokens = input_length
```

**User**

if use higher TPS, which variables changed? raw samples? feature frames?

---

**Cursor**

Great question! Let me clarify what changes when you use higher TPS and what stays the same.

Looking at the calculation pipeline:

```python
# Step 1: Raw audio to feature frames
audio_length = math.ceil(len(audio_) / processor.feature_extractor.hop_length)

# Step 2: Feature frames to input length  
input_length = (audio_length - 1) // 2 + 1

# Step 3: Input length to token count
num_audio_tokens = (input_length - 2) // 2 + 1
```

## What DOESN'T Change with Higher TPS

1. **Raw samples**: `len(audio_)` stays the same
   - A 10-second audio file at 16kHz will always have 160,000 samples
   - This is determined by the audio duration and sampling rate

2. **Feature frames**: `audio_length` stays the same  
   - Still `160,000 / 160 = 1,000 frames` for our example
   - This is determined by the feature extractor's `hop_length`, not the tokenizer

## What CHANGES with Higher TPS

Only the **downsampling ratios** in steps 2 and 3 need to change:

### Current Implementation (~25 TPS):
```python
input_length = (audio_length - 1) // 2 + 1      # Divide by 2
num_audio_tokens = (input_length - 2) // 2 + 1  # Divide by 2 again
# Total downsampling: 4x (2 × 2)
```

### For Higher TPS (e.g., 50 TPS - double the rate):
```python
input_length = audio_length                      # No downsampling
num_audio_tokens = (input_length - 2) // 2 + 1  # Divide by 2 only
# Total downsampling: 2x (1 × 2)
```

### For Even Higher TPS (e.g., 100 TPS - 4x the rate):
```python
input_length = audio_length                      # No downsampling  
num_audio_tokens = input_length                  # No downsampling
# Total downsampling: 1x (no downsampling)
```

## Example with Numbers

For 10-second audio (1,000 feature frames):

| TPS Target | input_length calculation | num_audio_tokens calculation | Final tokens |
|------------|-------------------------|------------------------------|--------------|
| 25 TPS (current) | `(1000-1)//2+1 = 500` | `(500-2)//2+1 = 250` | 250 |
| 50 TPS (2x) | `1000` | `(1000-2)//2+1 = 500` | 500 |  
| 100 TPS (4x) | `1000` | `1000` | 1000 |

## Key Insight

The **feature extraction stage remains unchanged** because it's determined by the audio model's architecture (hop_length, window size, etc.). Only the **tokenization ratios** change to achieve different TPS rates.

This makes sense because:
- Feature extraction is about converting audio waveforms to spectral representations
- Tokenization is about how many discrete tokens represent those features
- You can have the same features but different token granularities

```python
# Step 1: Raw audio to feature frames
audio_length = math.ceil(len(audio_) / processor.feature_extractor.hop_length)

# Step 2: Feature frames to input length  
input_length = (audio_length - 1) // 2 + 1

# Step 3: Input length to token count
num_audio_tokens = (input_length - 2) // 2 + 1
```

```python
input_length = (audio_length - 1) // 2 + 1      # Divide by 2
num_audio_tokens = (input_length - 2) // 2 + 1  # Divide by 2 again
# Total downsampling: 4x (2 × 2)
```

```python
input_length = audio_length                      # No downsampling
num_audio_tokens = (input_length - 2) // 2 + 1  # Divide by 2 only
# Total downsampling: 2x (1 × 2)
```

```python
input_length = audio_length                      # No downsampling  
num_audio_tokens = input_length                  # No downsampling
# Total downsampling: 1x (no downsampling)
```
